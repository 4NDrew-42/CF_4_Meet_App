# Meet App

Meet App is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built using React and the test-driven development (TDD) technique. It fetches upcoming events using the Google Calendar API, allowing users to search for events in various cities, view event details, and visualize event data through charts.

## Development Server

Run `npm start` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `npm run generate component <component-name>` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.
